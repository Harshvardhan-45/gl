          <h1>What is global Warming</h1>
          <p>
            Since the Industrial Revolution, the global annual temperature has
            increased in total by a little more than 1 degree Celsius, or about
            2 degrees Fahrenheit. Between 1880—the year that accurate
            recordkeeping began—and 1980, it rose on average by 0.07 degrees
            Celsius (0.13 degrees Fahrenheit) every 10 years. Since 1981,
            however, the rate of increase has more than doubled: For the last 40
            years, we’ve seen the global annual temperature rise by 0.18 degrees
            Celsius, or 0.32 degrees Fahrenheit, per decade.The result? A planet
            that has never been hotter. Nine of the 10 warmest years since 1880
            have occurred since 2005—and the 5 warmest years on record have all
            occurred since 2015. Climate change deniers have argued that there
            has been a “pause” or a “slowdown” in rising global temperatures,
            but numerous studies, including a 2018 paper published in the
            journal Environmental Research Letters, have disproved this claim.
            The impacts of global warming are already harming people around the
            world. Now climate scientists have concluded that we must limit
            global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2040 if we are to avoid a
            future in which everyday life around the world is marked by its
            worst, most devastating effects: the extreme droughts, wildfires,
            floods, tropical storms, and other disasters that we refer to
            collectively as climate change. These effects are felt by all people
            in one way or another but are experienced most acutely by the
            underprivileged, the economically marginalized, and people of color,
            for whom climate change is often a key driver of poverty,
            displacement, hunger, and social unrest.

        <h3>What causes global warming</h3>
        <p>
          Global warming occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) and other air
          pollutants collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar
          radiation that have bounced off the earth’s surface. Normally this
          radiation would escape into space, but these pollutants, which can
          last for years to centuries in the atmosphere, trap the heat and cause
          the planet to get hotter. These heat-trapping pollutants—specifically
          carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, water vapor, and synthetic
          fluorinated gases—are known as greenhouse gases, and their impact is
          called the greenhouse effect.

          point in the last 800,000 years<br />
          2.Since 1870, global sea levels have risen by about 8 inches<br />
          3. The Last Decade Was the Hottest in 125,000 Years<br />
          4.We Are Losing 1.2 Trillion Tons of Ice Each Yea<br />
          5.The Arctic is one of the worst places to be affected by global
          warming.<br />
          6. The Arctic ice is melting rapidly. By 2040 the region is expected
          to have a completely ice-free summer or even earlier.<br/>
